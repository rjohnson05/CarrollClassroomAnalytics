# Carroll College Classroom Analytics Software

This software is a tool created for Caroll College, providing them with the ability to analyze the data of a single course schedule. Via a heatmap, it shows how many classrooms are being used during any particular 
time throughout the week. It also provides a list of used classrooms for any particular time, along with the courses being held within the classroom. A classroom's schedule may also be viewed, showing all courses
held in a particular classroom on the current course schedule. This software has the capability to handle only one course schedule at a time. As such, if a new course schedule is uploaded, all data from the previous
course schedule will be deleted. However, any classroom data uploaded will be preserved between course schedules. To update the classroom information, a new spreadsheet must be uploaded with the corrected information.

## Setting Up the Application
Before launching the application, a database must be created. Ensure that you have MySQL downloaded onto your machine before completing the following steps: 
1. Log into the root account: `mysql -u root -p`
2. Type your password when prompted
3. Once logged into the root account, create a new database: `CREATE DATABASE carroll_classrooms;`
4. Create a new user: `CREATE USER 'caroll_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Comfypillow01*';`
5. Log out of the root account and log in as this newly created user: `mysql -u carroll_user -p carroll_classrooms`
6. Enter the userâ€™s password: `Comfypillow01*`
7. Give this user privileges on the newly created database: `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'carroll_user'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;`

The database for the application is now created with a user able to access it. Next, the database structure used by the application must be moved into the created database. Before running these steps, ensure that 
you have Python installed on your machine. 
1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/rjohnson05/CarrollClassroomAnalytics`
2. Move into the parent directory of the project
3. Load the database structure: `py manage.py migrate`

Next, install the necessary dependencies and build the front end of the project. Ensure that you are still in the parent directory of the project. 
1. Install necessary back end dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Move into the frontend directory
3. Install frontend dependencies: `npm install`
4. Build the React front end for production: `npm run build`
5. Move back to the parent directory of the project

Lastly, launch the program by running this command: `py manage.py runserver`. The application should now be visible after navigating to `localhost:8000` within a web browser.
