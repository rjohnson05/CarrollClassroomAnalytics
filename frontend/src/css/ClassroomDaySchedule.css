/*
Stylesheet for the component that displays the course being used during a specific time block during the day. A time
block is considered as the period between each course start/end time. This component is similar to the heatmap component
shown on the main page, except that only one color is used to show when the classroom contains a course. When a time
block is hovered over, a tooltip shows information about the course using the classroom during the time block.
